Some various projects that I have made whilst messing about with a Raspberry Pi Pico

Some (or many) of them don't work properly, or had changes since being in a working state

I wouldn't recommend running any of this without looking at what it does first. Some comments attempt to describe what is happening, but are usually only used when I need to remind myself what things do.
