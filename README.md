# mypico

Some various projects that I have made whilst messing about with a Raspberry Pi Pico

Some (or many) of them don't work properly, or had changes since being in a working state

I wouldn't recommend running any of this without looking at what it does first. Some comments attempt to describe what is happening, but are usually only used when I need to remind myself what things do.

If you want to build or use anything, then you need to have set up the pico sdk first. If any of the code doesn't work or breaks something, this is not my responsibility, but feel free to make bug reports that I can ignore.

## AutoLightStrip

This controls a WS2812b light strip, with a choice of patterns.

The brightness can be controlled by a potentiometer.

See code for configuration / pinouts etc.

The code needs a bit of a tidy-up, but I just wanted to get some rainbow lights and this achieves the basic functionality I wanted.
